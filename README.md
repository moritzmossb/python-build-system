# Pybuild - a pythonic build system for C/C++

Ever get tired of Make or Cmake? Use `pybuild` to configure your project in `json` and enjoy not 
directly interacting with any configuration file, since `pyuild` comes with a nice CLI interface,
which allows you to:
* build components
* link objects into executables
* basic C/C++ ''library management''
